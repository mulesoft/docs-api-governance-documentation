= Creating Completely New Custom Rulesets

If you want a custom ruleset that cannot be created by modifying one of the provided rulesets, use one of the following approaches:

* Search the https://help.mulesoft.com/s/ideas[MuleSoft Ideas Portal^] for ideas for new rulesets that have already been submitted. If you do not find your idea there, consider submitting your idea in the MuleSoft Ideas Portal.
* Generate a ruleset using CLI commands by scaffolding it from a specification's data schema. See <<scaffold-rulesets>>.
* Create a ruleset using the custom ruleset CLI commands, see <<create-rulesets-using-cli>>.
* Create a ruleset using the ruleset modeling language, see <<create-rulesets-using-code>>.

After you create the ruleset:

. Validate the changes using the `governance:ruleset:validate` command.
. Generate the ruleset documentation. 
. Publish your custom ruleset as a new asset using the Exchange UI or the `anypoint-cli exchange asset upload` command. 
+
See xref:custom-rulesets-validate-and-publish.adoc[].

NOTE: As with custom code and configurations, rulesets are not considered supported MuleSoft products. For help with issues with custom rulesets, post an issue in the https://github.com/aml-org/amf-custom-validator[AMF Custom Validator Github repository^].

== Generating Rulesets from a Specification

You can generate a starter ruleset from specifications' data schemas using the following command sequence:

. <<inspect-for-api-type>>
. <<initialize-ruleset-from-dataschema>>

[[inspect-for-api-type]]
=== Inspect API Specifications for API Type

Use the following command to inspect API specifications for API type. This helps you determine which data schema to use.

include::anypoint-cli::partial$api-governance.adoc[tag=governance-api-inspect,leveloffset=+1]

[[initialize-ruleset-from-dataschema]]
=== Initialize Rulesets from Data Schemas

Use the following command to initialize rulesets from data schemas.

include::anypoint-cli::partial$api-governance.adoc[tag=governance-ruleset-init,leveloffset=+1]

== Create Rulesets Using the Ruleset Development CLI

An open-source version of the Ruleset Development CLI is available on npm. It is provided separately from the Anypoint CLI `governance` commands, and is documented separately. 

To create rulesets using the Ruleset Development CLI:

. Install `ruleset-development-cli` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aml-org/ruleset-development-cli[npmjs.com^].
. Follow the https://github.com/aml-org/amf-custom-validator/blob/develop/docs/validation_tutorial/validation.md[AMF Rulesets tutorial] to create a ruleset. 

[[create-rulesets-using-code]]
== Create Rulesets Using the Modeling Language

To create rulesets using the modeling language, read the https://a.ml/docs/amf/using-amf/amf_custom_validation[AMF Custom Validation section^] in the AML Open Source project to become familiar with how to write a ruleset using the modeling language.

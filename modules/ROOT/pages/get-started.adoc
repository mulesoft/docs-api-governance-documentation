= Getting Started with Anypoint API Governance

After you become familiar with the UI and concepts covered in the xref:index.adoc[Anypoint API Governance Overview], you are ready to get started governing your APIs.

== Before You Begin

* Ensure you have access to the API Governance console:

** The *API Governance* > *Governance View* permission allows view-only access to some of the console information, such as the governance report. 
** The *API Governance* > *Governance Administrator* permission allows full view and administrative access.
 
* If you have an opt-in banner in the API Governance console, opt in to get additional functionality. See the xref:release-notes::api-governance/api-governance-release-notes.adoc[] for details.
+
If you don't see the opt-in banner, you already have access to the new functionality.
+
This documentation is written for the full product functionality that is available after the opt-in.

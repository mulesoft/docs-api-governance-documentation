= Getting Started with Anypoint API Governance

After you become familiar with the UI and concepts covered in the xref:index.adoc[Anypoint API Governance Overview], you are ready to get started governing your APIs.

== Before You Begin

* To access the API Governance console, you must have the *API Governance* > *Governance Administrator* permission.

* If you have an opt-in banner in the API Governance console, opt in to get additional functionality. See the xref:release-notes::api-governance.adoc[Anypoint API Governance Release Notes] for details.
+
If you don't see the opt-in banner, you already have access to the new functionality.
+
This documentation is written for the full product functionality that is available after the opt-in.

. xref:install-cli.adoc[(Optional) Install Anypoint CLI] to run `governance` commands locally or in automation tools.

= Getting Started with API Governance

After you become familiar with the API Governance UI and concepts covered in the xref:index.adoc[API Governance Overview], you are ready to get started governing your APIs.

== Before You Begin

* To access the API Governance console, you must have the *API Governance* > *Governance Administrator* permission.

* Opt in to govern by API version rather than by asset version. By opting in, you get the additional functionality to govern all instances for all versions of an API and view a detailed governance report in both API Governance and API Manager. The opt-in applies to all of your business groups (organizations). See the xref:release-notes::api-governance.adoc[API Governance Release Notes] for details.
+
If you don't see the option to opt in, you already have access to the new features.
+
This documentation is written for the full-featured governance after opt-in.

== Govern Your APIs

Govern your APIs using the following steps:

. xref:install-cli.adoc[(Optional) Install the API Governance CLI] to run commands locally or in automation tools.

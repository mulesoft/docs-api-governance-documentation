= Getting Started with API Governance

After you become familiar with the API Governance UI and concepts covered in the xref:index.adoc[API Governance Overview], you are ready to get started governing your APIs.

== Before You Begin

. To access the API Governance console:

* You must have the *Anypoint API Governance administrator* permission set by your Anypoint Platform administrator.

. Opt in to the new features using the prompts in the API Governance UI. This enables full instance governance for API versions and a detailed governance report in API Governance and API Manager. See the xref:release-notes::api-governance.adoc[the API Governance Release Notes] for details.
+
* If you don't see the option to opt in, you already have access to the new features.
+
* This documentation is written for the full-featured governance after opt-in.

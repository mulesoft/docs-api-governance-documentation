= Monitoring API Conformance

After you configure governance profiles for your APIs and the resulting governance data is available, you can monitor and report on your organization's API definitions' conformance success and failure.  

== Status Information on the Console

You can view the latest status information on the console.

[[gov-profiles]]
=== Governance Profile Statuses

You can view profile statuses in the console. Governance profile statuses are based on the percentage of conformant APIs in the profile:

* *Normal:* More than 70% of APIs are conformant.
* *At Risk:* Less than 70% of APIs are conformant.

[[api-conformance]]
=== API Conformance Across Governance Profiles

API conformance status indicates whether the API definitions that are included in your governance profiles pass all applied governance rulesets:

* *Conformant:* The APIs pass all applied governance rulesets.
* *Not Conformant:* The APIs fail at least one governance ruleset.
* *Not Validated:* The APIs are not validated because they are not included in a governance profile.

[[nonconformance-severity]]
=== Nonconformance by Severity Across Governance Profiles

Nonconformance severity is categorized by the percentage of passed governance rulesets among all applied governance rulesets:

* *High Severity:* 0 - 40% Governance rulesets passed
* *Medium Severity:* 41% - 80% Governance rulesets passed
* *Low Severity:* 81% - 99% Governance rulesets passed

== Reports

You can export reports of your governance information, which downloads the data to a `.csv` file. 

=== Governance Profile Report
On the main API Governance console page, select the *Profiles* tab and then click the *Export Report* button to export a report of governance profile information, such as: 

* Organization ID 
* Profile IDs
* Profile name
* Status
* Total APIs validated
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps
* Associated ruleset tags

=== Validated API Report
On the main API Governance console page, select the *APIs* tab and then click the *Export Report* button to export a report that shows your validated APIs' information, such as:  

* Organization ID 
* API IDs
* Versions
* Total number of APIs
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps

=== Specific Profile Report
On a selected governance profile page, click the more options menu icon (image:overflow-menu-icon.png[width=0.75%,height=0.75%,title="Screenshot of the more options menu icon"]) and then select *Export Reports* to export a report that shows the selected governance profile's information, such as: 

* Organization ID
* API IDs
* Versions
* Total number of APIs
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps

== Evaluate API Conformance Using the CLI

If you want to use a command to evaluate the potential rulesets for your API project, use the `governance api evaluate` command.

Those who do not have access to API Governance, such as developers, can use the CLI to evaluate which rulesets their APIs might be subject to validation against based on given filters. This enables developers to be proactive in understanding the potential conformance of APIs to rulesets before their APIs become governed. 

Additionally, those who do have access to API Governance, such as governance officers, might use this command to plan or debug profile configurations.

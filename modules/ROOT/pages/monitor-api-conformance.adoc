After you configure governance profiles for your APIs and the resulting governance data is available, you can monitor and report on your organization's REST API definitions' conformance success and failure.  

== Status Information on the Console

You can view the latest status information on the console.

[[gov-profiles]]
=== Governance Profile Statuses

You can view profile statuses in the console. Governance profile statuses are based on the percentage of conformant APIs in the profile:

* *Normal:* More than 70% of APIs are conformant.
* *At Risk:* Less than 70% of APIs are conformant.

[[api-conformance]]
=== API Conformance Across Governance Profiles

API conformance status indicates whether the API definitions that are included in your governance profiles pass all applied governance rulesets:

* *Conformant:* The APIs pass all applied governance rulesets.
* *Not Conformant:* The APIs fail at least one governance ruleset.
* *Not Validated:* The APIs are not validated because they are not included in a governance profile.

[[nonconformance-severity]]
=== Nonconformance by Severity Across Governance Profiles

Nonconformance severity is categorized by the percentage of passed governance rulesets among all applied governance rulesets:

* *High Severity:* 0 - 40% Governance rulesets passed
* *Medium Severity:* 41% - 80% Governance rulesets passed
* *Low Severity:* 81% - 99% Governance rulesets passed

== Reports

You can export reports of your governance information, which downloads the data to a `.csv` file.

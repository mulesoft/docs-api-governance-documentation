= Monitoring API Conformance

After you configure governance profiles for your APIs and the resulting governance data is available, you can monitor and report on your organization's API specifications' conformance success and failure.  

== Status Information on the Console

You can view the latest status information in the console.

NOTE: Only API Governance and organization administrators can create, edit, and delete profiles.

== Governance Conformance Report

You can view conformance details for governed APIs in their governance validation reports in API Governance console and API Manager. See xref:find-and-fix-conformance-issues.adoc[].

== Export Conformance Information

You can export conformance information in CSV format from several places in the API Governance console. 

* <<gov-profile-export>>
* <<gov-api-export>>
* <<gov-spec-profile-export>>

[[gov-profile-export]]
=== Governance Profile Export
On the main API Governance console page, select the *Profiles* tab and then click the *Export Report* button to export governance profile information, such as: 

* Organization ID 
* Profile IDs
* Profile name
* Status
* Total APIs validated
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps
* Associated ruleset tags

[[gov-api-export]]
=== Governed API Export
On the main API Governance console page, select the *Governed APIs* tab and then click *Export Report* to export the governed API information, such as:  

* Organization ID 
* API IDs
* Versions
* Total number of APIs
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps

[[gov-spec-profile-export]]
=== Specific Profile Export
On a selected governance profile page, click the more options menu icon (image:overflow-menu-icon.png[width=9,height=15,fit=line]) and then select *Export Reports* to export a report that shows the selected governance profile's information, such as: 

* Organization ID
* API IDs
* Versions
* Total number of APIs
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps

[[eval-api-conf-cli]]
== Evaluate API Conformance Using the CLI

To use a command to evaluate the potential rulesets for your API project, use the `governance:api:evaluate` command.

Those who do not have access to API Governance, such as developers, can use the CLI to evaluate which rulesets their APIs might be subject to validation against based on given filters. This enables developers to be proactive in understanding the potential conformance of APIs to rulesets before their APIs become governed. 

Additionally, those who do have access to API Governance, such as governance officers, might use this command to plan or debug profile configurations.

= Monitoring API Conformance

After you configure governance profiles for your APIs and the resulting governance data is available, you can monitor and report on your organization's API specifications' conformance success and failure.  

== Assessing Governance Impacts Using Draft Profiles

Some APIs might be targeted by both draft and active profiles, but if an API is targeted only by one or more draft profiles, the only way to view the conformance is to view it within the context of a draft profile that targets it. 

To view API conformance information for APIs targeted by draft profiles:

. On the main API Governance console page, select the *Profiles* tab.
. Select *Draft*.
. xxx

== Monitoring Conformance Information on the Console

To view API conformance information for APIs targeted by active profiles, view the latest summary information in the API Governance console (admin only) and in validation reports.

NOTE: Only API Governance and organization administrators can create, edit, and delete profiles.

== Governance Validation Report

You can view conformance details for governed APIs in their governance validation reports in API Governance console and API Manager. See xref:find-and-fix-conformance-issues.adoc[].

== Export Conformance Information

You can export conformance information in CSV format from several places in the API Governance console. 

* <<draft-profile-export>>
* <<gov-profile-export>>
* <<gov-api-export>>
* <<gov-spec-profile-export>>

[[draft-profile-export]]
=== Draft Governance Profile Export

To export a conformance report for APIs targeted by a specific draft profile:

. On the main API Governance console page, select the *Profiles* tab.
. Select *Draft*.
. Click the *Export CSV* button to export governance profile information in CSV format, such as: 
+
* Organization ID 
* Profile IDs
* Profile name
* Status
* Total APIs validated
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps
* Associated ruleset tags

[[gov-profile-export]]
=== Active Governance Profile Export

To export a conformance report for APIs targeted by active profiles:

. On the main API Governance console page, select the *Profiles* tab.
. Select *Active*.
. Click the *Export Report* button to export governance profile information, such as: 
+
* Organization ID 
* Profile IDs
* Profile name
* Status
* Total APIs validated
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps
* Associated ruleset tags

[[gov-api-export]]
=== Governed API Export

To export a report of all governed APIs targeted by your active profiles:

. On the main API Governance console page, select the *Governed APIs* tab.
. Click *Export Report* to export the governed API information for all active profiles. 
+
The exported information includes:  
+
* Organization ID 
* API IDs
* Versions
* Total number of APIs
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps

[[gov-spec-profile-export]]
=== Specific Active Profile Export

To export a conformance report for APIs targeted by a specific active profile:

. On the main API Governance console page, select the *Profiles* tab.
. Select *Active*.
. On a selected governance profile page, click the more options menu icon (image:overflow-menu-icon.png[width=9,height=15,fit=line]).
. Select *Export Reports*.
+ 
This exports a report that shows the selected governance profile's information, such as: 
+
* Organization ID
* API IDs
* Versions
* Total number of APIs
* Number of conformant APIs (pass)
* Number of nonconformant APIs (fail)
* Timestamps

== Evaluate API Conformance Using the CLI

To use a command to evaluate the potential rulesets for your API project, use the `governance:api:evaluate` command.

Those who do not have access to API Governance, such as developers, can use the CLI to evaluate which rulesets their APIs might be subject to validation against based on given filters. This enables developers to be proactive in understanding the potential conformance of APIs to rulesets before their APIs become governed. 

Additionally, those who do have access to API Governance, such as governance officers, might use this command to plan or debug profile configurations.

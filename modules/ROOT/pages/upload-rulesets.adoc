= Creating Custom Rulesets in Anypoint Exchange

For the Beta, we have added MuleSoft Aypoint API Best Practices,
OpenAPI Best Practices, OWASP API Security Top 10, and Authentication
Security Best Practices rulesets to Exchange in advance. If you want
to create custom rulesets in Exchange, you would create them as any other asset.

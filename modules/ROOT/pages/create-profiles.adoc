= Applying Governance Rulesets to Specified APIs
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You don't want to apply all of your Governance Rulesets to all of
your APIs. Governance Rulesets should be applied based on the types of API
you are governing. 

For instance, for APIs that handle healthcare
information you would want to apply Governance Rulesets that make sure
all healthcare information standards are followed. Similarly,
for APIs that handle financial information, a different set
of standards would need to be followed. 

Additionally, considering you may have
hundreds of APIs, applying Governance Rulesets to each individual API is inefficient
and tedious. Instead, using Governance Profiles, you can apply Governance Rulesets to
specific types of APIs broadly by combining Governance Rulesets and API filter criteria.

== Create Governance Profiles

Once you have access to API Governance and you have created tags to specify the APIs
you want to govern, the next step in governing your APIs is creating a Governance Profile.
Governance Profiles pair Governance Rulesets with API filter criteria to allow you to govern APIs at scale.

.To create a Governance Profile: 

. Log in to Anypoint Platform using an account that has the API Governance permission.
. In the navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform page, click *API Governance*.
. Click *New Profile*.
. Enter a Governance Profile name that helps others understand what kinds of Governance Rulesets are included in it.
+
You can also add a purpose to explain more about your Governance Profile, like the kinds of APIs it governs.

. Click *Next*.
. Select one or more Governance Rulesets you want to use to govern your APIs.
. Click *Next*.
. Specify which APIs your Governance Profile should be applied to by selecting an API Type and/or Tag(s)
as filter criteria. 
+
The list of APIs shown includes which APIs the Governance Profile will be applied to based on your filter choices.
+
CAUTION: If you do not select filter criteria, your Governance Profile will be applied to *ALL* of your APIs in Exchange.
Also, the filter criteria will be applied to any APIs that are added to Exchange in the future.
+

NOTE: The only API Type available for filtering criteria for the beta release is REST APIS.

. Click *Next*.
. Review your profile and click *Create Profile*.

== Create Governance Profiles Using the API Governance CLI

=== governance console create

`> governance console create [options] <profile-name> <ruleset-gavs>`

This command creates a new Governance Profile. The argument "ruleset-gavs" should be a list of Governance Ruleset gavs formatted as follows:

<group_id>/<asset_id>/<version>,<group_id>/<asset_id>/<version>

*Options:*

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Option |Description

|--tags <tags>
|The `tags` argument should be followed by a comma separated list of tags to be applied to the new Governance Profile, formatted as follows: `tag1,tag2,tag3`.

|--description <description>
|The `description` argument should be followed by a string that is the new Governance Profile's description.
|===

*Example command:*
 `governance console create "Profile for Demos" a787009c-c5e5-43a8-8d6a-a4da6d6df0ac/demo/1.0.0 --tags DemosTag --description "This is the demo description"`

*Example output:*

`> governance console info <profile-id>`

This command lists all information for a specific Governance Profile Id.

*Example command:*
 `governance console info 8ffd463f-86b2-4132-afc6-44d179209362`

. In the navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform page, click *API Governanace*.
. On the Profiles tab of the API Governance console page, click the kebab icon for the
  Governance Profile you want to update, and select *Edit*.

  * API type
  * Tags
+
NOTE: After you have made your edits, the Total APIs will be updated to indicate how many APIs
your Governance Profile will include based on your updated filter criteria.

. Click *Update Profile*.

[[governance-console-update]]
=== governance console update

`> governance console update [options] <profile-id>`

This command updates an existing Governance Profile. You can update the Governance Profile's
Governance Rulesets, name, tags, and description.

NOTE: You must know the Governance Profile Id to edit a Governance Profile. You can get the

|===
|Option |Description

|--ruleset-gavs <ruleset-gavs>

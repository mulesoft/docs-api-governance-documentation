= Finding API Conformance Issues in API Definitions

Apply governance rulesets to API definitions as you author them, either in Design Center using API Designer 
or by using the governance CLI. You can also validate governance rulesets to make sure they are formatted correctly using the governance CLI.

== Validate API Definitions in Design Center

To validate APIs against governance rulesets, add the rulesets as dependencies to API specifications in Design Center API Designer. After you add the rulesets, expand the *Project Errors* section to view conformance messages.

<1> Add rulesets to your API project.

<2> View conformance issues and filter by level of severity.

<3> Expand the <<project-errors,*Project Errors*>> section of the text editor to view nonconformance messages. 

See xref:design-center::design-add-api-dependency.adoc[Adding Dependencies to an API-Specification Project].

== Validate API Definitions Against Governance Rulesets Using the API Governance CLI

If you want to use a command to validate your API definition against governance rulesets, use the `governance api validate` command.

=== Limitations

This command does not validate the dependencies of the API definition, such as fragments.

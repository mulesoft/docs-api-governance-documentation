= Finding API Conformance Issues in API Definitions

Governance Rulesets can be applied to API definitions as you are authoring them, either in Design Center
or with the API Governance CLI. You can also validate Governance Rulesets to make sure they are formatted
correctly with the API Governance CLI.

== Validate API Definitions in Design Center

You can add Governance Rulesets as dependencies to API definitions projects in
Design Center. Once added, you will see errors or warnings in the console
as you are writing your API definition.

== Validate Governance Rulesets and API Definitions Using the API Governance CLI

This command allows you to test your Governance Rulesets as you are developing them to be sure your format is correct.
It can also be used to validate an API definition against a Governance Ruleset.

NOTE: API definition dependencies are not supported at this time.

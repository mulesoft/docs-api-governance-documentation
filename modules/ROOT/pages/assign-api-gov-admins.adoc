Once API Governance has been added to your Anypoint Platform instance,
you will need to assign API Governance administrator privileges
to users for them to be able to use it.

IMPORTANT: If you do not see API Governance, it hasn't been added to your Anypoint
Platform instance yet. You can have it added by contacting MuleSoft and providing
your Organization Id. See xref:access-management::organization.adoc#manage-root-organization-settings[Manage Root Organization Settings]
for more information on how to find your Organization Id.

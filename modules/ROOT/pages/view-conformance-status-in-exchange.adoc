= Viewing Conformance Status in Exchange 

You can view conformance status in Exchange for APIs that are validated by API Governance. If an API is validated:

* A conformance badge is displayed for a selected API version.
* A *Conformance* column shows conformance for each validated version of the API in the *Manage Versions* page. 
* A *Conformance Status* page gives conformance details. If an API has been validated against centralized governance rulesets, a conformance status page appears in Exchange for that API. 

To view conformance status in Exchange:

. Select an API asset in Exchange. 

. Review the conformance badge beside the lifecycle state badge.
+
. To see conformance by version, click *Manage Versions*.
+
Review the *Conformance* column, which shows the governance conformance status for each validated version.
+
. To view conformance details, select the *Conformance Status* page in the left navigation.
From the conformance status page, you can:
+
* Select the version of the API that you want to view.
* View the lists of centralized governance rulesets and additional rulesets against which the API has been validated.
** Click the *Show All* link to show the full list of rulesets if there are more than are shown on the initial page.
** Click the external link icon beside a ruleset to view that ruleset asset's page in Exchange. 
* For nonconformant APIs, click *Fix the API Definition* and then select from one of the following:
** *Fix Using Design Center*
+ 
After your API definition is opened in Design Center, view the conformance messages in the *Project Errors* section to fix and republish your API definition to make it conformant with the listed rulesets.
** *Fix Using Anypoint CLI*
+
Follow the prompts on the page to copy, update, and run the Anypoint CLI commands to fix and republish your API definition to make it conformant with the listed rulesets.

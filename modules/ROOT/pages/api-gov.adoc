Anypoint API Governance is a component of the Anypoint Platform that
allows you to apply governance rules to your APIs as part of the
API lifecycle. Governance rules can include internal or external best
practice guidelines and industry-specific government regulations.
You can apply these reusable groups of rules, or rulesets,
directly to API definitions during the API design phase. Later, you can add
these same rulesets to governance profiles and apply the governance profiles to multiple APIs across
your organization. Once the governance profiles have been applied to your APIs, you can
then monitor your APIs' conformance on the API Governance console.

API Governance is tightly integrated with the following tools:

* xref:design-center::index.adoc[Anypoint Design Center (Design Center)], where governance
  rules are designed and applied to API definitions (as dependencies)
* xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange (Exchange)], where governance rules are catalogued and discovered

== API Governance Components, Concepts, and Features

=== Governance Profiles

A governance profile applies chosen rulesets to a select group of APIs. The APIs are validated
against the rulesets to check conformance status. Conformance status is the percentage
of APIs included in the governance profile that conform, or meet the rulesets' rules.

A governance profile has two statuses, Normal and At Risk, which are based on the percentage
of conformant APIs in the governance profile.

* *Normal:* More than 70% of APIs are conformant
* *At Risk:* Less than 70% of APIs are conformant

=== Rulesets

Rulesets are collections of rules, or guidelines, that can be applied over the metadata extracted from any
REST API definition in the Anypoint Platform. Rulesets can include internal or external best
practice guidelines and industry-specific government regulations. You can create custom rulesets using the
AML(Anything Modeling Language), a declarative language for defining metadata documents.

=== API Conformance

API conformance is the whether the included API definitions that are cataloged in Exchange as REST APIs,
meet all required rules included in the rulesets from one or multiple governance profiles.

=== Compliance Posture

The status of your API definitions' compliance to certain regulations, internal or external. 

=== API Governance Console

The main UI for API Governance where you can view governance profile statuses, API conformance
across governance profiles, and nonconformance by severity across governance profiles. You can
also add, update, and delete governance profiles from this page.

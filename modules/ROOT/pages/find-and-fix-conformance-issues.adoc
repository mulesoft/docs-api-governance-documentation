= Finding and Fixing Conformance Issues

To find conformance issues, use API Governance profiles, API Designer ruleset dependencies, or CLI commands to validate the APIs against the set of rulesets to which you want your APIs to conform. After you validate the APIs, you can see conformance badges in API Governance, Exchange, and API Manager and view detailed conformance information in API Governance, Exchange, API Manager, and Design Center. 
Nonconformance messages give details on conformance issues and contextual links direct you to the best place to address them.

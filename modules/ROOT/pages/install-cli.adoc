Since API Governance is a Beta, you will need to install a specific
version of the Anypoint CLI to get access to the API Governance commands.

If you already have the Anypoint CLI installed on your device, this version
of the Anypoint CLI will overwrite what you have installed, adding the API
Governance commands.

== Install the API Governance CLI

Use the xref:3.x@anypoint-cli::index.adoc[Anypoint CLI installation instructions] with the following
exceptions: 

* We recommend you install NPM 7 if you don't have it already installed.
* To get the correct version of Anypoint CLI with API Governance included
use the following command: 
[source,bash]
----
npm i anypoint-cli@3.9.4-beta.governance

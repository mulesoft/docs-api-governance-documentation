Since API Governance is a Beta, you will need to install a specific
version of the Anypoint CLI to get access to the API Governance commands.

If you already have the Anypoint CLI installed on your device, this version
of the Anypoint CLI will overwrite what you have installed, adding the API
Governance commands.

== Install the API Governance CLI

Install as follows: 

* We recommend you install NPM 7 if you don't have it already installed. See the https://nodejs.org/en/download/[NodeJS download page].
* Install Anypoint CLI with API Governance included using the following command: 
[source,bash]
----
npm i anypoint-cli@3.9.4-beta.governance
----

To limit governance to sets of APIs you are ready to govern,  identify the API assets in Exchange. This enables you to apply rulesets to specific sets of APIs when you create governance profiles. It also ensures that governance conformance notifications are sent only to the API owners who have been informed and are ready to begin making their APIs conformant to your conformance profiles.

To identify the APIs you want to govern, add asset tags to the API assets in Exchange.

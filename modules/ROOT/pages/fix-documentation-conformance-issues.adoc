= Finding and Fixing Conformance Issues in API Documentation

You can validate API documentation using a ruleset provided by MuleSoft or a custom ruleset with rules that validate API documentation. A ruleset provided by MuleSoft that validates API catalog documentation is:

* API Documentation Best Practices

You can fix API documentation issues by updating the documentation associated with the API to conform to the rules it violated. 
One way to do this is as follows:

. In Exchange, navigate to the API that has documentation conformance issues. Do one or more of the following:
.. Select *Home* in the sidebar navigation and enter documentation directly in the Home page.
.. Download the API and use an editor such as API Design Center to update the documentation section of the API.
.. Use API Notebook to update the documentation.

= Fixing Conformance Issues in API Instances

After API Governance identifies conformance issues in your API instances, you can fix them in API Manager. Use the API validation report to find the conformance issues. If the validation messages don't have enough detail to help you fix the issue, open the ruleset for the offending rule and view the documentation for that ruleset to get the information you need.

For example, if you receive the following conformance issue:

`xxx`

In the validation report for that API instance, xxx

xxx screenshot xxx

Open that ruleset in Exchange and find the rule that the API violated. The description there gives information on how to fix the issue in API Manager.

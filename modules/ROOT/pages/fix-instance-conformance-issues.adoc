= Fixing Conformance Issues in API Instances

After API Governance identifies conformance issues in your API instances, you can fix them in API Manager. Use the API governance report to find the conformance issues. 

To fix conformance issues in instances:

. Select the *Conformance Report* page for the API that is marked as nonconformant.

+
. View the messages to see what you need to do and click the link to API Manager to fix the issue.
. If the nonconformance messages don't have enough detail to help you fix the issue, open the ruleset for the offending rule and view the documentation for that ruleset to get the information you need.
